this project is a programme that helps you to memorize the tasks that you should do !
currently the program has some limitations , like that you can't add a description for your task , but will try to improve it as much as possible after finishing the current flutter course.

for now , in my mind that I must add that features : 
    1. sending notification when the deadline comes.
    2. add animation to make to programme more user friendly.
    3. add priority so the user can choose what tasks that appear on the top of the other !
    4. add some instruction to the user....

wish me luck :)
